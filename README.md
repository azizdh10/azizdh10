## Hi there 👋

I'm Aziz Dhifallah, a Full Stack Developer based in Tunis, Tunisia. I'm currently a final-year Information Systems Development student with a deep passion for building modern web and mobile applications.




I mostly work on full-stack projects using Spring Boot and Java for the backend, paired with Vue.js or React for the frontend. I also dive into mobile development with Flutter and Kotlin, and I enjoy managing the "under the hood" side of things like MySQL databases and server administration.





Right now, I am actively seeking a Final Year Project (PFE) internship starting in February 2026 where I can contribute to innovative real-world projects and further sharpen my professional skills.

Tools & Tech

Frontend & Mobile: Vue.js, React, Flutter, Dart, Bootstrap 





Backend & Languages: Java, Spring Boot, Python, C, JavaScript 





Databases & Infrastructure: MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Hyper-V, Windows Server 




Design & DevOps: Figma, Adobe XD, Git/GitHub, Linux 

A Bit About Me
🌍 Bilingual: I’m fluent in both English and French (B2 level).

🛠️ Versatile: I don't just write code; I can set up your entire virtual network, from Domain Controllers to DHCP services.

🚀 Proactive: I love automating critical processes—like the KPI dashboard I built for centralized IT management.

🔮 Forward-Looking: My resume shows me finishing my degree in 2026, so I'm technically already living in the future!
